How to open your mission in 3den

3. Double click on the mission

How to move respawn point

How to move initial spawn point
1. Open mission in 3den

3. Move all of these objects (including the zeus modules) to the desired location, players will spawn in the location of these NPCs according to which slot they choose

How to move quartermaster
1. Open mission in 3den
2. In the entities search box (top left), search "1RAR Arsenal"
3. Move all of these objects to the desired location (Note that the quartermaster will attach himself to the invisible helipad so any movements to him in 3den will not be reflected unless you also move this helipad)
